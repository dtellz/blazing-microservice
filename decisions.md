# Python version

Python 3.12.7 will be used for this project. Python 3.13.0 has been released recently, but might not yet be supported by the libraries we use, and we want to avoid any issues due to the time constraints.

Pyenv will be used to manage the Python versions.

# Package manager

We will use Poetry to manage the dependencies of the project.
