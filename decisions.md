# Python version

Python 3.12.7 will be used for this project. Python 3.13.0 has been released recently, but might not yet be supported by the libraries we use, and we want to avoid any issues due to the time constraints.

Pyenv will be used to manage the Python version.

# Package manager

We will use Poetry to manage the dependencies of the project. 

# Pre-commit hooks

We will use pre-commit to mantain PEP8 compliance and autoformat the code.
